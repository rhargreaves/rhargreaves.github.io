<p>Mixing music from Sonic The Hedgehog with rap song acapellas is nothing new. I've always wanted to do something like this because it's not particularly hard and it often gives an additional dimension to the tune. Some on the internet are just plain awful, but my hope is that this isn't one of them. Both tunes are particularly "bad-ass" so it just felt right trying them out together. </p>
<p>Anyway.. enjoy!</p>
