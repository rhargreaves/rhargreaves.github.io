You shouldn't need to sacrifice modern-day development practices when programming against older hardware.

As such, I'm going to be writing up a series of posts on how you can apply Continuous Delivery principles and methodologies to Sega Mega Drive development. I will be covering the following topics:

# Topics

- Part 1: Local Development Environment
- Part 2: Continuous Integration & Deployment
- Part 3: Test-Driven Development
- Part 4: Debugging

Stay tuned!
