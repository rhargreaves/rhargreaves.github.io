<p>Over at the <a href="http://www.kevinenjoyce.com/soulwax/forum/viewtopic.php?id=776">soulwax.info</a> forum, we've set ourselves the challenge of creating a member-led mix named "Nothing But Love". Every song in it must either have the word "love" in the title, or be themed on love. Tracks that have been played by 2manydjs during their live sets were not allowed.</p>
<p>The mix comprised of 4 parts, each part being worked on by a member of the forum. I was allocated part 3, and this was my contribution...</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
